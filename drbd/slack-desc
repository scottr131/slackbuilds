drbd: DRBD (networked RAID 1 functionality for GNU/Linux)
drbd:
drbd: DRBD, developed by [LINBIT](https://www.linbit.com), provides 
drbd: networked RAID 1 functionality for GNU/Linux. It is designed for high
drbd: availability clusters and software defined storage. DRBD keeps disks
drbd: on multiple nodes synchronized using TCP/IP or RDMA and makes the 
drbd: data available as a block device. This results in RAID 1 but without
drbd: the use of uncommon hardware such as shared SCSI buses or Fibre
drbd: Channel.
